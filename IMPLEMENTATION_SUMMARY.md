## Complete Payment Flow

### Phase 1: Contract Creation
1. Freelancer creates contract with payment terms
2. System auto-configures WPYUSD for USD payments
3. Freelancer wallet captured from Privy
4. Contract saved with Web3 configuration

### Phase 2: Contract Signing & Invoice Creation
1. Freelancer signs contract
2. `Web3EscrowService.createInvoiceFromContract()` called
3. Invoice created in Firestore with unique payment link
4. `createOnchainInvoice()` called to create on-chain invoice
5. Invoice ID hashed with keccak256 for blockchain

### Phase 3: Client Payment
1. Client accesses `/pay/:payLinkToken`
2. Connects wallet (MetaMask)
3. Gets test tokens via faucet if needed
4. Calls `fundInvoice()`:
   - Approves WPYUSD to escrow contract
   - Calls `fund()` on escrow contract
5. Status updated to 'funded' in Firestore

### Phase 4: Payment Release
1. Client releases payment after work completion
2. Calls `releaseInvoice()` with invoice ID
3. Escrow releases funds to freelancer wallet
4. Status updated to 'paid' in Firestore

### Phase 5: Monitoring & Reconciliation
1. Freelancer can sync blockchain state manually
2. `fetchInvoiceState()` reads current blockchain state
3. Firestore updated if state differs
4. Transaction links to Citrea explorer
